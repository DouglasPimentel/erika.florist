Watched this one in the plane, it was fun.

I thought the movie was too long, certain parts didn't really mean anything nor did they feel needed for anything else. I also though it was pretty weird how much of a hero Cruella is in this movie, in the end, the only "bad thing" she does is stealing towards the beginning of the movie, the rest is relatively harmless

I also wasn't always too sure of the demographics the movie was made for, at some points it felt like a relatively kid-teen movies and at other points it tried to be a bit more adult, I think it failed at both

It was a fun watch though
