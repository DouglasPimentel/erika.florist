  <p>My real name is <span class="font-bold text-beach-watermelon">Erika</span> but maybe you know me under the nickname <span class="font-semibold text-pinky-unicorny">Princesseuh</span> 👸, that's okay!</p>

  <p>I'm a web/game developer from Canada 🇨🇦, pleased to meet you! Truth be told, I'm not as interested in programming as I once used to be, however, I'm definitely still a nerd at heart and having your own website is still a really cool thing, so hey, welcome to my website! Feel free to browse around!</p>

  Interested in seeing stuff I worked on? Click <a href="">here for my projects</a>! Wanna read stuff I wrote? Well, lucky you, <a href="">here's my blog</a>! You want to read random stuff I wrote mostly for myself? Well, <a href="">my wiki is right here</a>!&nbsp;🎉
