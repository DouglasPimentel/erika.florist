I'm usually a pretty tolerant person regarding softwares, I recognize that some things are hard to make and that it's hard to please everyone. That's fair

However, there's some softwares, libraries and frameworks that I believe are just terribly badly designed and at this point, maybe can't even be salvaged

Please keep in mind that most of these entries are written out of immediate frustration and thus, are not very nuanced. Aditionally, I don't hate the developers that worked on them, I'm sure the result is a product of the environnement they were developed in and might have been subjects to tight schedules and lack of budget, but still, the result is unfortunately frustating (probably for everyone involved)

## The Shopify API

Shopify itself is fine, the admin dashboard is terribly slow (it's made using React after all) but it isn't that bad. There's a few weirdness there and there but it's (mostly) usable

Its API however, is unusable. The documentation is very hard to browse in addition of being often incomplete and the libraries they provide to developers are unmaintained, not up to standards and full of issues.

It's very painful to work with - no matter what language and way you try to use it, it's always a very unpleasant experience and has been so for years now. Disappointing

(If a Shopify engineer ever read this, half the issues I have can be fixed by providing Typescript typings for the Storefront API and `js-buy-sdk`)
