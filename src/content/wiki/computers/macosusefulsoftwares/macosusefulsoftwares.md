macOS has ok usability by default, most of the time at least. Some of the bundled softwares are good ideas but have terrible execution, the biggest example of this is Spotlight, which works nicely but is so insanely slow that it completely ruins the usefulless

Luckily, for most things, there's third party alternatives / plugins / modifications that can help a lot, here I'll list the neat softwares I use

## Free

### TinkerTool

One of macOS's biggest flaws is the lack of customization options it provides. There's a fairly numerous amount of tiny things I wish I could just slightly change, luckily [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) allows that

It doesn't necessarily have that many tweaks available but I found the ones available really useful already, notably the ability to disable delay before showing the dock in auto-hide mode

## Free with paid features

### Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is pretty well known at this point, after all it released about 10 years ago. Not only is it the best application launcher for macOS, it's also (in my opinion) the best application launcher that exists no matter the platform

Unfortunately a lot of the features are locked behind a paywall but I think it's very much worth it for the huge productivity boost that it provides. It's much better than Spotlight, macOS's default application launcher

## Paid

### Mission Control Plus

Mission Control works, that's about it. For something that is supposed to be one the main way to manage your open windows and activities, it's however, very barebones. Notably, you can't close windows in it which to me, is absolutely insane and I can't believe you still can't even in Monterey. Shame on Apple

Thankfully, [Mission Control Plus](https://www.fadel.io/missioncontrolplus) exists for that and works nicely. However, it's paid but personally, I don't mind spending a bit of my money for a better workflow, but it's insulting to have to pay for such a small thing that should definitely be there by default
