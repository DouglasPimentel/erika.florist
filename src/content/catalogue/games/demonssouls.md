One of my favorite games of all time! I didn't play it as much as its successor, Dark Souls

I really appreciate how weird it is, a lot of hidden mechanics, things that don't make sense and environnements that are not PLEASANT to go through. It feels like the game always hate you, everyone and everything want you away which is such a refreshing feeling in video games. I'm all for it

(Originally played years ago towards its release, dates are from a recent playthrough)
