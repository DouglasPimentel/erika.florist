One of the best Yuri offering in mangas in recent years, it starts off a bit too classic which I didn't like at first but I then figured that, we needed more "classics except gay" mangas and that it wasn't that much of a problem

Some parts of the storyline I didn't care much for, for instance the MC's sister but it ends on such a satisfying note that everything was fine. I recommend
