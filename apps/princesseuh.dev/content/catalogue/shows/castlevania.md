I really really liked this! I found the artstyle very charming. All the characters having long faces made me simp for most of them, especially the ladies, season 4 could've been a 10 episodes Lenore fan cam and I would have liked it just as much haha

The only thing that I didn't like is that I felt like there was a bit too much fighting, especially in the later seasons. I think I would've liked more talking and more casual scenes between the characters instead of endless fighting. Though, I guess the endless fighting made sense in the context of the story

Alucard was such a good character, James Callis was amazing, his voice felt so sad, so melancholic at times, wow. I really want to replay Symphony of the Night now!

I cried a few tears at the end, I loved it, I heavily recommend it
