The [catalogue](/catalogue) is one of my favorite part of this website. I think that it's a very powerful page that will get more and more impressive as things are added (trying my best to keep it up to date!)

## Why?

I kinda don't like the platforms for cataloging the medias you play/watch/read, they often have social elements that I don't care about, incite you to rate stuff etc.

My catalogue is my own, I do it for me. Nothing is rated, nothing is too serious. It's things I do with a few quick thoughts, nothing more. It's public for fun, it could easily have been private

## When was it started?

I started it in late 2020, so it's missing a lot of stuff. I retroactively add things that I have a clear remembrance of because of recent experience, the rest will have to wait until a replay/rewatch/reread before adding, even for my favorite things (it's currently missing a lot of my favorite things haha!)

## Any omitted content?

So far, not really. However, if I do eventually add very NSFW content, it'll be behind an opt-in filter and won't be shown by default (especially because of covers)

It should be noted that I only add content that I finish, if I couldn't bring myself to finish a thing, it doesn't belong in my catalogue (though I do keep private notes regarding that to avoid forgetting)

## Can I add one to my own website?

Sure! The idea was inspired by [Mark Llobrera's reading log](https://www.markllobrera.com/reading/) so it's already not original. Definitely feel free to create your own. Create one that fits your exact needs, you'll be proud of it!
